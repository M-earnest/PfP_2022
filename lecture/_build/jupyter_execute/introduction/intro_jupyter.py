<img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeerHerholz/ML-DL_workshop_SynAGE/master/lecture/static/jupyter_example.png" alt="logo" title="jupyter" width="900" height="400" /> 

## Before we get started 2...
    
We're going to be working in [Jupyter notebooks]() for most of this presentation!

To load yours, do the following:

1. Open a terminal/shell & navigate to the folder where you stored the course material (`cd`)

2. Type `jupyter notebook`

3. If you're not automatically directed to a webpage copy the URL (`https://....`) printed in the `terminal` and paste it in your `browser`

## Files Tab

The `files tab` provides an interactive view of the portion of the `filesystem` which is accessible by the `user`. This is typically rooted by the directory in which the notebook server was started.

The top of the `files list` displays `clickable` breadcrumbs of the `current directory`. It is possible to navigate the `filesystem` by clicking on these `breadcrumbs` or on the `directories` displayed in the `notebook list`.

A new `notebook` can be created by clicking on the `New dropdown button` at the top of the list, and selecting the desired `language kernel`.

`Notebooks` can also be `uploaded` to the `current directory` by dragging a `notebook` file onto the list or by clicking the `Upload button` at the top of the list.

### The Notebook

When a `notebook` is opened, a new `browser tab` will be created which presents the `notebook user interface (UI)`. This `UI` allows for `interactively editing` and `running` the `notebook document`.

A new `notebook` can be created from the `dashboard` by clicking on the `Files tab`, followed by the `New dropdown button`, and then selecting the `language` of choice for the `notebook`.

An `interactive tour` of the `notebook UI` can be started by selecting `Help` -> `User Interface Tour` from the `notebook menu bar`.

### Header

At the top of the `notebook document` is a `header` which contains the `notebook title`, a `menubar`, and `toolbar`. This `header` remains `fixed` at the top of the screen, even as the `body` of the `notebook` is `scrolled`. The `title` can be edited `in-place` (which renames the `notebook file`), and the `menubar` and `toolbar` contain a variety of actions which control `notebook navigation` and `document structure`.

<img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeerHerholz/ML-DL_workshop_SynAGE/master/lecture/static/notebook_header_4_0.png" alt="logo" title="jupyter" width="600" height="100" /> 

### Body

The `body` of a `notebook` is composed of `cells`. Each `cell` contains either `markdown`, `code input`, `code output`, or `raw text`. `Cells` can be included in any order and edited at-will, allowing for a large amount of flexibility for constructing a narrative.

- `Markdown cells` - These are used to build a `nicely formatted narrative` around the `code` in the document. The majority of this lesson is composed of `markdown cells`.
- to get a `markdown cell` you can either select the `cell` and use `esc` + `m` or via `Cell -> cell type -> markdown`

<img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeerHerholz/ML-DL_workshop_SynAGE/master/lecture/static/notebook_body_4_0.png" alt="logo" title="jupyter" width="700" height="200" />

- `Code cells` - These are used to define the `computational code` in the `document`. They come in `two forms`: 
    - the `input cell` where the `user` types the `code` to be `executed`,  
    - and the `output cell` which is the `representation` of the `executed code`. Depending on the `code`, this `representation` may be a `simple scalar value`, or something more complex like a `plot` or an `interactive widget`.
- to get a `code cell` you can either select the `cell` and use `esc` + `y` or via `Cell -> cell type -> code`

- `Raw cells` - These are used when `text` needs to be included in `raw form`, without `execution` or `transformation`.

<img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeerHerholz/ML-DL_workshop_SynAGE/master/lecture/static/notebook_body_4_0.png" alt="logo" title="jupyter" width="700" height="200" />
 

### Modality

The `notebook user interface` is `modal`. This means that the `keyboard` behaves `differently` depending upon the `current mode` of the `notebook`. A `notebook` has `two modes`: `edit` and `command`.

`Edit mode` is indicated by a `green cell border` and a `prompt` showing in the `editor area`. When a `cell` is in `edit mode`, you can type into the `cell`, like a `normal text editor`.

<img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeerHerholz/ML-DL_workshop_SynAGE/master/lecture/static/edit_mode.png" alt="logo" title="jupyter" width="700" height="100" /> 

`Command mode` is indicated by a `grey cell border`. When in `command mode`, the structure of the `notebook` can be modified as a whole, but the `text` in `individual cells` cannot be changed. Most importantly, the `keyboard` is `mapped` to a set of `shortcuts` for efficiently performing `notebook and cell actions`. For example, pressing `c` when in `command` mode, will `copy` the `current cell`; no modifier is needed.

<img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeerHerholz/ML-DL_workshop_SynAGE/master/lecture/static/command_mode.png" alt="logo" title="jupyter" width="700" height="100" /> 

### Mouse navigation

The `first concept` to understand in `mouse-based navigation` is that `cells` can be `selected by clicking on them`. The `currently selected cell` is indicated with a `grey` or `green border depending` on whether the `notebook` is in `edit or command mode`. Clicking inside a `cell`'s `editor area` will enter `edit mode`. Clicking on the `prompt` or the `output area` of a `cell` will enter `command mode`.

The `second concept` to understand in `mouse-based navigation` is that `cell actions` usually apply to the `currently selected cell`. For example, to `run` the `code in a cell`, select it and then click the  `Run button` in the `toolbar` or the `Cell` -> `Run` menu item. Similarly, to `copy` a `cell`, select it and then click the `copy selected cells  button` in the `toolbar` or the `Edit` -> `Copy` menu item. With this simple pattern, it should be possible to perform nearly every `action` with the `mouse`.

`Markdown cells` have one other `state` which can be `modified` with the `mouse`. These `cells` can either be `rendered` or `unrendered`. When they are `rendered`, a nice `formatted representation` of the `cell`'s `contents` will be presented. When they are `unrendered`, the `raw text source` of the `cell` will be presented. To `render` the `selected cell` with the `mouse`, click the  `button` in the `toolbar` or the `Cell` -> `Run` menu item. To `unrender` the `selected cell`, `double click` on the `cell`.

### Keyboard Navigation

The `modal user interface` of the `IPython Notebook` has been optimized for efficient `keyboard` usage. This is made possible by having `two different sets` of `keyboard shortcuts`: one set that is `active in edit mode` and another in `command mode`.

The most important `keyboard shortcuts` are `Enter`, which enters `edit mode`, and `Esc`, which enters `command mode`.

In `edit mode`, most of the `keyboard` is dedicated to `typing` into the `cell's editor`. Thus, in `edit mode` there are relatively `few shortcuts`. In `command mode`, the entire `keyboard` is available for `shortcuts`, so there are many more possibilities.

The following images give an overview of the available `keyboard shortcuts`. These can viewed in the `notebook` at any time via the `Help` -> `Keyboard Shortcuts` menu item.

<img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeerHerholz/ML-DL_workshop_SynAGE/master/lecture/static/notebook_shortcuts_4_0.png" alt="logo" title="jupyter" width="500" height="500" /> 

The following shortcuts have been found to be the most useful in day-to-day tasks:

- Basic navigation: `enter`, `shift-enter`, `up/k`, `down/j`
- Saving the `notebook`: `s`
- `Cell types`: `y`, `m`, `1-6`, `r`
- `Cell creation`: `a`, `b`
- `Cell editing`: `x`, `c`, `v`, `d`, `z`, `ctrl+shift+-`
- `Kernel operations`: `i`, `.`

### Markdown Cells

`Text` can be added to `IPython Notebooks` using `Markdown cells`. `Markdown` is a popular `markup language` that is a `superset of HTML`. Its specification can be found here:

http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/

You can view the `source` of a `cell` by `double clicking` on it, or while the `cell` is selected in `command mode`, press `Enter` to edit it. Once a `cell` has been `edited`, use `Shift-Enter` to `re-render` it.

### Markdown basics

You can make text _italic_ or **bold**.

You can build nested itemized or enumerated lists:

* One
    - Sublist
        - This
  - Sublist
        - That
        - The other thing
* Two
  - Sublist
* Three
  - Sublist

Now another list:

1. Here we go
    1. Sublist
    2. Sublist
2. There we go
3. Now this

You can add horizontal rules:

---

Here is a blockquote:

> Beautiful is better than ugly.
> Explicit is better than implicit.
> Simple is better than complex.
> Complex is better than complicated.
> Flat is better than nested.
> Sparse is better than dense.
> Readability counts.
> Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
> Although practicality beats purity.
> Errors should never pass silently.
> Unless explicitly silenced.
> In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
> There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
> Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
> Now is better than never.
> Although never is often better than *right* now.
> If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
> If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
> Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

You can add headings using Markdown's syntax:

<pre>
# Heading 1

# Heading 2

## Heading 2.1

## Heading 2.2
</pre>

### Embedded code

You can embed code meant for illustration instead of execution in Python:

    def f(x):
        """a docstring"""
        return x**2

or other languages:

    if (i=0; i<n; i++) {
      printf("hello %d\n", i);
      x += 4;
    }

### Github flavored markdown (GFM)

The `Notebook webapp` supports `Github flavored markdown` meaning that you can use `triple backticks` for `code blocks` 
<pre>
```python
print "Hello World"
```

```javascript
console.log("Hello World")
```
</pre>

Gives 
```python
print "Hello World"
```

```javascript
console.log("Hello World")
```

And a table like this : 

<pre>
| This | is   |
|------|------|
|   a  | table| 
</pre>

A nice HTML Table

| This | is   |
|------|------|
|   a  | table| 

### General HTML

Because `Markdown` is a `superset of HTML` you can even add things like `HTML tables`:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Header 1</th>
<th>Header 2</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>row 1, cell 1</td>
<td>row 1, cell 2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>row 2, cell 1</td>
<td>row 2, cell 2</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Local files

If you have `local files` in your `Notebook directory`, you can refer to these `files` in `Markdown cells` directly:

    [subdirectory/]<filename>

For example, in the `static folder`, we have the `logo`:

    <img src="static/pfp_logo.png" />

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeerHerholz/Python_for_Psychologists_Winter2021/master/lecture/static/pfp_logo.png" width=300 />


These do not `embed` the data into the `notebook file`, and require that the `files` exist when you are viewing the `notebook`.

### Security of local files

Note that this means that the `IPython notebook server` also acts as a `generic file server` for `files` inside the same `tree` as your `notebooks`. Access is not granted outside the `notebook` folder so you have strict control over what `files` are `visible`, but for this reason **it is highly recommended that you do not run the notebook server with a notebook directory at a high level in your filesystem (e.g. your home directory)**.

When you run the `notebook` in a `password-protected` manner, `local file` access is `restricted` to `authenticated users` unless `read-only views` are active.

### Markdown attachments

Since `Jupyter notebook version 5.0`, in addition to `referencing external files` you can `attach a file` to a `markdown cell`. To do so `drag` the `file` from e.g. the `browser` or local `storage` in a `markdown cell` while `editing` it:

`![pfp_logo.png](attachment:pfp_logo.png)`

![pfp_logo.png](attachment:pfp_logo.png)

`Files` are stored in `cell metadata` and will be `automatically scrubbed` at `save-time` if not `referenced`. You can recognize `attached images` from other `files` by their `url` that starts with `attachment`. For the `image` above:

    ![pfp_logo.png](attachment:pfp_logo.png)

Keep in mind that `attached files` will `increase the size` of your `notebook`.

You can manually edit the `attachement` by using the `View` > `Cell Toolbar` > `Attachment` menu, but you should not need to.

### Code cells

When executing code in `IPython`, all valid `Python syntax` works as-is, but `IPython` provides a number of `features` designed to make the `interactive experience` more `fluid` and `efficient`. First, we need to explain how to run `cells`. Try to run the `cell` below!

import pandas as pd

print("Hi! This is a cell. Click on it and press the ‚ñ∂ button above to run it")

You can also run a cell with `Ctrl+Enter` or `Shift+Enter`. Experiment a bit with that.

### Tab Completion

One of the most useful things about `Jupyter Notebook` is its tab completion.

Try this: click just after `read_csv`( in the cell below and press `Shift+Tab` 4 times, slowly. Note that if you're using `JupyterLab` you don't have an additional help box option.

pd.read_csv(

After the first time, you should see this:

<img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeerHerholz/ML-DL_workshop_SynAGE/master/lecture/static/jupyter_tab-once.png" alt="logo" title="jupyter" width="700" height="200" /> 

After the second time:

<img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeerHerholz/ML-DL_workshop_SynAGE/master/lecture/static/jupyter_tab-twice.png" alt="logo" title="jupyter" width="500" height="200" /> 

After the fourth time, a big help box should pop up at the bottom of the screen, with the full documentation for the `read_csv` function:

<img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeerHerholz/ML-DL_workshop_SynAGE/master/lecture/static/jupyter_tab-4-times.png" alt="logo" title="jupyter" width="700" height="300" /> 

This is amazingly useful. You can think of this as "the more confused I am, the more times I should press `Shift+Tab`".

Okay, let's try `tab completion` for `function names`!

pd.r

You should see this:

<img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeerHerholz/ML-DL_workshop_SynAGE/master/lecture/static/jupyter_function-completion.png" alt="logo" title="jupyter" width="300" height="200" /> 

## Get Help

There's an additional way on how you can reach the help box shown above after the fourth `Shift+Tab` press. Instead, you can also use `obj`? or `obj`?? to get help or more help for an object.

pd.read_csv?

## Writing code

Writing code in a `notebook` is pretty normal.

def print_10_nums():
    for i in range(10):
        print(i)

print_10_nums()

If you messed something up and want to revert to an older version of a code in a cell, use `Ctrl+Z` or to go than back `Ctrl+Y`.

For a full list of all keyboard shortcuts, click on the small `keyboard icon` in the `notebook header` or click on `Help` > `Keyboard Shortcuts`.

### The interactive workflow: input, output, history

`Notebooks` provide various options for `inputs` and `outputs`, while also allowing to access the `history` of `run commands`.

2+10

_+10


You can suppress the `storage` and `rendering` of `output` if you append `;` to the last `cell` (this comes in handy when plotting with `matplotlib`, for example):

10+20;

_


The `output` is stored in `_N` and `Out[N]` variables:

_8 == Out[8]

Previous inputs are available, too:

In[9]

_i

%history -n 1-5

### Accessing the underlying operating system

Through `notebooks` you can also access the underlying `operating system` and `communicate` with it as you would do in e.g. a `terminal` via `bash`:

!pwd

files = !ls
print("My current directory's files:")
print(files)

!echo $files

!echo {files[0].upper()}

### Magic functions

`IPython` has all kinds of `magic functions`. `Magic functions` are prefixed by `%` or `%%,` and typically take their `arguments` without `parentheses`, `quotes` or even `commas` for convenience. `Line magics` take a single `%` and `cell magics` are prefixed with two `%%`.

Some useful magic functions are:

Magic Name | Effect
---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------
%env       | Get, set, or list environment variables
%pdb       | Control the automatic calling of the pdb interactive debugger
%pylab     | Load numpy and matplotlib to work interactively
%%debug    | Activates debugging mode in cell
%%html     | Render the cell as a block of HTML
%%latex    | Render the cell as a block of latex
%%sh       | %%sh script magic
%%time     | Time execution of a Python statement or expression

You can run `%magic` to get a list of `magic functions` or `%quickref` for a reference sheet.

%magic

`Line` vs `cell magics`:

%timeit list(range(1000))

%%timeit
list(range(10))
list(range(100))

`Line magics` can be used even inside `code blocks`:

for i in range(1, 5):
    size = i*100
    print('size:', size, end=' ')
    %timeit list(range(size))

`Magics` can do anything they want with their input, so it doesn't have to be valid `Python`:

%%bash
echo "My shell is:" $SHELL
echo "My disk usage is:"
df -h

Another interesting `cell magic`: create any `file` you want `locally` from the `notebook`:

%%writefile test.txt
This is a test file!
It can contain anything I want...

And more...

!cat test.txt

Let's see what other `magics` are currently defined in the `system`:

%lsmagic

## Writing latex 

Let's use `%%latex` to render a block of `latex`:

%%latex
$$F(k) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{2\pi i k} \mathrm{d} x$$

### Running normal Python code: execution and errors

Not only can you input normal `Python code`, you can even paste straight from a `Python` or `IPython shell session`:

>>> # Fibonacci series:
... # the sum of two elements defines the next
... a, b = 0, 1
>>> while b < 10:
...     print(b)
...     a, b = b, a+b

In [1]: for i in range(10):
   ...:     print(i, end=' ')
   ...:     

And when your code produces errors, you can control how they are displayed with the `%xmode` magic:

%%writefile mod.py

def f(x):
    return 1.0/(x-1)

def g(y):
    return f(y+1)

Now let's call the function `g` with an argument that would produce an error:

import mod
mod.g(0)

%xmode plain
mod.g(0)

%xmode verbose
mod.g(0)

The default `%xmode` is "context", which shows additional context but not all local variables.  Let's restore that one for the rest of our session.

%xmode context

## Running code in other languages with special `%%` magics

%%perl
@months = ("July", "August", "September");
print $months[0];

%%ruby
name = "world"
puts "Hello #{name.capitalize}!"

### Raw Input in the notebook

Since `1.0` the `IPython notebook web application` supports `raw_input` which for example allow us to invoke the `%debug` `magic` in the `notebook`:

mod.g(0)

%debug

Don't forget to exit your `debugging session`. `Raw input` can of course be used to ask for `user input`:

enjoy = input('Are you enjoying this tutorial? ')
print('enjoy is:', enjoy)

### Plotting in the notebook

`Notebooks` support a variety of fantastic `plotting options`, including `static` and `interactive` graphics. This `magic` configures `matplotlib` to `render` its `figures` `inline`:

%matplotlib inline

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 300)
y = np.sin(x**2)
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title("A little chirp")
fig = plt.gcf()  # let's keep the figure object around for later...

import plotly.figure_factory as ff

# Add histogram data
x1 = np.random.randn(200) - 2
x2 = np.random.randn(200)
x3 = np.random.randn(200) + 2
x4 = np.random.randn(200) + 4

# Group data together
hist_data = [x1, x2, x3, x4]

group_labels = ['Group 1', 'Group 2', 'Group 3', 'Group 4']

# Create distplot with custom bin_size
fig = ff.create_distplot(hist_data, group_labels, bin_size=.2)
fig.show()

## The IPython kernel/client model

%connect_info

We can connect automatically a Qt Console to the currently running kernel with the `%qtconsole` magic, or by typing `ipython console --existing <kernel-UUID>` in any terminal:

%qtconsole

## Saving a Notebook

`Jupyter Notebooks` `autosave`, so you don't have to worry about losing code too much. At the top of the page you can usually see the current save status:

`Last Checkpoint: 2 minutes ago (unsaved changes)`
`Last Checkpoint: a few seconds ago (autosaved)`

If you want to save a notebook on purpose, either click on `File` > `Save` and `Checkpoint` or press `Ctrl+S`.

## To Jupyter & beyond
